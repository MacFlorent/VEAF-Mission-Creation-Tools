      <description>Introduction This module creates a radio menu (VEAF / ASSETS) that allows the players to manage the mission air assets.
For each air asset, they can request information (is the asset alive ? What information has the mission maker set up - radio frequencies, TACANs, etc.), respawn the asset (and its eventual linked DCS groups, e.g. escort planes for a High Value Target), dispose of the asset (if set up by the mission maker).</description>

      <description>Introduction This module helps place a Forward Armament and Refuel Point (FARP) in a mission. It also helps with grass runways (hence its name). The mission creator simply has to place one or few units in the DCS mission editor, and name them following a specific convention; the script will then automatically find and dress these units up at mission start.

      <description>Introduction This module creates a radio menu (VEAF / CARRIER OPERATIONS) that allows the players to manage the aircraft carriers (CV) in the mission, at runtime.
For each CV, they can get information (including ATC) and start/end carrier air operations (CAO). During CAO, the CV will sail into the wind at a speed and heading computed to get a specific wind speed right in front of the runway. A rescue helicopter (Pedro) and an emergency tanker can be placed in the mission and will be launched and recovered at appropriate times.</description>

      <description>Introduction This module allows the user to define groups that can be spawned in a mission using either the veafSpawn, the veafInterpreter or the veafCombatZone modules. It is also possible to define aliases for units that will be used in groups, or spawned directly.
