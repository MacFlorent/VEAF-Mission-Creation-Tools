	"content": "Introduction With these tools offered free of charge by the Virtual European Air Force, any mission maker can easily create a complex, dynamic mission in the DCS mission editor. In as little as 1 or 2 hours, you will have a mission with :\n a complex setup of dozens of units, easily added by using special templating commands. a system that dresses up FARP units to make them complete forwards bases of operations, with the required logistic vehicles, tents, guards and even windsocks a build system that will normalize your mission files so they aren't completely randomized and shuffled each time you edit them with the DCS editor. a radio presets frequencies injector; it'll use a template to set all the radio presets in the players planes. a player-controlled radio menu to control this mission at runtime. a robust, easy-to-setup security system that can restrict certain features to specific user groups. a Zeus-like system that can be used to spawn AI groups, convoys and units at runtime. a carrier vehicle that can automatically navigate upwind when requested by the players, and automatically return to its initial location afterwards; it can also manage a rescue helicopter on station (port side of the ship), and a S3-B emergency tanker. a ground attack mission system; this will generate a ground attack mission when requested, and create the radio menus needed to control it. a helo transport mission system; this will generate a helicopter transport mission when requested, and create the radio menus needed to control it.  Prerequisites There are two sets of prerequisites to use the VEAF Mission Creation Tools. First, if you simply want to use them in your missions, then you'll need :\n DCS World (of course) mist.lua (provided in the community folder)  But if you want to use the full development environment, and take advantage of the advanced features (normalization, injection), and easily publish your mission to a source control system (e.g. GitHub), you'll also need :\n git an IDE (notepad++, visual studio code\u0026hellip;) npm - for that install node.js 7za from the 7-Zip Extra: standalone console version lua from Lua for Windows  How to set up a mission You can clone the VEAF-Demo-Mission repository and use it as an example (or fork it and create a new mission from your fork). Then you should read the readme.md file in this repository. It will explain how you should setup your development environment. There is detailed documentation for all the modules:\n veafAssets veafCarrierOperations veafGrass veafUnits veafSpawn  "

	"content": "Introduction This module creates a radio menu (VEAF / ASSETS) that allows the players to manage the mission air assets.\nFor each air asset, they can request information (is the asset alive ? What information has the mission maker set up - radio frequencies, TACANs, etc.), respawn the asset (and its eventual linked DCS groups, e.g. escort planes for a High Value Target), dispose of the asset (if set up by the mission maker).\nHow to set up a mission Let's start by saying that you can clone the VEAF-Demo-Mission repository and use it as an example (or fork it and create a new mission from your fork).\nLoad the script and its prerequisites In DCS mission editor, set up a \u0026ldquo;mission start\u0026rdquo; trigger that will :\n load the following scripts (in order) :  mist.lua (from the community folder) veaf.lua veafRadio.lua veafAssets.lua   run the following lua code : veafRadio.initialize();veafAssets.initialize(); load a new file that you'll write, and that will initialize the veafAsset script specifically for your mission ; usually it's called veafAssetsConfig.lua, and if you follow our model (VEAF-Demo-Mission) it's stored in the scripts folder of your mission.  How to configure the script in a mission The veafAssetsConfig.lua file will declare a table, listing all the assets in your mission along with the information you want the players to receive.\nHere's a annotated example:\nveafAssets.Assets = {\r-- list the assets common to all missions below\r {sort=1, name=\u0026#34;Arco\u0026#34;, description=\u0026#34;Arco (KC-135)\u0026#34;, information=\u0026#34;Tacan 11Y\\nVHF 130.4 Mhz\\nZone OUEST\u0026#34;, linked={\u0026#34;Arco-escort1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Arco-escort2\u0026#34;}},\r{sort=2, name=\u0026#34;Petrolsky\u0026#34;, description=\u0026#34;900 (IL-78M, RED)\u0026#34;, information=\u0026#34;VHF 267 Mhz\u0026#34;, linked=\u0026#34;Petrolsky-escort\u0026#34;}, {sort=3, name=\u0026#34;Mig-28\u0026#34;, description=\u0026#34;Mig-29x2 (dogfight zone, RED)\u0026#34;, disposable=true, information=\u0026#34;They spawn near N41° 09\u0026#39; 31\\\u0026#34;E043° 05\u0026#39; 08\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;},\r}\rIn this code, we define 3 assets.\nFirst, Arco (the name attribute must contain the name of the group in DCS) is a tanker, described by \u0026ldquo;Arco (KC-135)\u0026rdquo; (the description field is the name that will appear in the radio menu). It has information that players can request freely (in the information attribute); it also has two linked DCS groups (not listed in the assets list, although they could be) : Arco-escort1 and Arco-escort2 (these are the name of the groups in DCS). When the players choose to respawn Arco, these linked groups will also automatically be respawned.\nPetrolsky has the same characteristics, except that it has a single linked group, described using the concise syntax (a single string instead if a list).\nMig-28 is an aggressor F5 (of course) which is disposable. It means that the player can choose not only to respawn it when they want to, but also to dispose of it when they don't want to play with it anymore. In this particular case (an AI aggressor plane), the mission maker should put it in the mission with the \u0026ldquo;Late activation\u0026rdquo; setting checked, so it is only spawned when players respawn it with this script.\nHow to use in a mission The radio menu will list all the assets defined in the veafAssets.Assets table, and for each asset add submenus :\n respawn the asset and its linked groups info shows information about the asset, if provided in the information tag dispose disposes of the asset if disposable is set to true  "

	"content": "Introduction This module creates a radio menu (VEAF / CARRIER OPERATIONS) that allows the players to manage the aircraft carriers (CV) in the mission, at runtime.\nFor each CV, they can get information (including ATC) and start/end carrier air operations (CAO). During CAO, the CV will sail into the wind at a speed and heading computed to get a specific wind speed right in front of the runway. A rescue helicopter (Pedro) and an emergency tanker can be placed in the mission and will be launched and recovered at appropriate times. After some time (45 or 90 minutes), it will automatically sail at flank speed to its initial position.\nHow to set up a mission Let's start by saying that you can clone the VEAF-Demo-Mission repository and use it as an example (or fork it and create a new mission from your fork).\nLoad the script and its prerequisites In DCS mission editor, set up a \u0026ldquo;mission start\u0026rdquo; trigger that will :\n load the following scripts (in order) :  mist.lua (from the community folder) veaf.lua veafRadio.lua veafCarrierOperations.lua   run the following lua code : veafRadio.initialize();veafCarrierOperations.initialize();  How to configure the script in a mission The name that is given to the CV is central to all the configuration of this module.

	"content": "Introduction This module allows the user to define groups that can be spawned in a mission using either the veafSpawn, the veafInterpreter or the veafCombatZone modules. It is also possible to define aliases for units that will be used in groups, or spawned directly.\nHow to set up a mission Let's start by saying that you can clone the VEAF-Demo-Mission repository and use it as an example (or fork it and create a new mission from your fork).\nLoad the script and its prerequisites In DCS mission editor, set up a \u0026ldquo;mission start\u0026rdquo; trigger that will :\n load the following scripts (in order) :  mist.lua (from the community folder) veaf.lua veafUnits.lua any module that you'll use to spawn the groups (veafSpawn, veafInterpreter or veafCombatZone)   run the following lua code : veafUnits.initialize();  You can use the groups defined in the veafUnits.lua script, or define your own groups by creating a mission-specific file :\n load a new file that you'll write, and that will add entries in the veafUnits databases specifically for your mission ; usually it's called veafUnitsConfig.lua, and if you follow our model (VEAF-Demo-Mission) it's stored in the scripts folder of your mission.  How to configure the script in a mission The veafUnitsConfig.lua file will add entries to the veafUnits.UnitsDatabase and/or veafUnits.GroupsDatabase tables\nHere's a annotated example:\ntable.insert(veafUnits.UnitsDatabase, {\raliases = {\u0026#34;sa15\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sa-15\u0026#34;},\runitType = \u0026#34;Tor 9A331\u0026#34;,\r})\rIn this code, we add aliases for the Tor SAM system (more on the syntax later).\ntable.insert(veafUnits.GroupsDatabase, {\raliases = {\u0026#34;rapier_optical\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rpo\u0026#34;},\rgroup = {\rdisposition = { h= 3, w= 5},\runits = {{\u0026#34;rapier_fsa_optical_tracker_unit\u0026#34;, cell = 13}, {\u0026#34;rapier_fsa_launcher\u0026#34;, cell = 1}, {\u0026#34;rapier_fsa_launcher\u0026#34;, cell = 5}},\rdescription = \u0026#34;Rapier SAM site\u0026#34;,\rgroupName = \u0026#34;Rapier\u0026#34;\r},\r})\rIn this code, we add a group called rpo or rapier_optical that contains 3 units (more on the syntax later).\nUnit aliases syntax The syntax of an entry in the veafUnits.UnitsDatabase is quite simple. Example :\n{\raliases = {\u0026#34;sa15\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sa-15\u0026#34;},\runitType = \u0026#34;Tor 9A331\u0026#34;,\r}\rAn entry is composed of 2 elements :\n the aliases keyword defines a list of aliases that can be used to refer to the unit the unitType keyword specifies which DCS unit is referred to from the list defined in dcsUnits.lua (not very up-to-date).  Group definition syntax A group is a list of units that are used together to form a usable battle group.\nIt has a layout template, used to make the group units spawn at the correct place and heading. The syntax of an entry in the veafUnits.GroupsDatabase is much more complex than a simple alias. Example :\n{\raliases = {\u0026#34;Tarawa\u0026#34;},\rgroup = {\rdisposition = { h = 3, w = 3},\runits = { {\u0026#34;tarawa\u0026#34;, 2}, {\u0026#34;PERRY\u0026#34;, 7}, {\u0026#34;PERRY\u0026#34;, 9} },\rdescription = \u0026#34;Tarawa battle group\u0026#34;,\rgroupName = \u0026#34;Tarawa\u0026#34;,\r}\r}\rSyntax aliases The aliases keyword defines a list of aliases that can be used to refer to the group.\nExample :\naliases = {\u0026#34;sa2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sa-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fs\u0026#34;},\rdisposition The disposition keyword defines the group layout template (see explanation of group layouts below).\nExample :\ndisposition = { h= 6, w= 8},\runits The units keyword defines a list of all the units composing the group.\nExample :\nunits = {\r{\u0026#34;IFV Hummer\u0026#34;, cell = 1, fitToUnit},\r{\u0026#34;Truck Predator GCS\u0026#34;, cell = 3, hdg = 225},\r{\u0026#34;Truck M 818\u0026#34;, number = 4, random},\r{\u0026#34;Truck M978 HEMTT Tanker\u0026#34;, number = {min=0, max=3}, random},\r},\r the first element of the unit table is always the unit type, either from the dcsUnits database, or from an alias in veafUnits.UnitsDatabase. the position of the unit is either specified with the cell parameter (containing the cell number), or left as random if the cell keyword is omitted. the random parameter, if set, means that the unit will be placed randomly in the cell, leaving a one unit size margin around. the hdg parameter, if set, fixes the unit heading (in degrees, from 0 to 359); when not set, unit heading is random. the number parameter is used to spawn multiple units in several cells; it cannot be combined with the cell parameter, of course, and can either be a fixed number or an interval from which the actual number of units will be chosen randomly. fitToUnit, when specified, makes the cell shrink around the unit ; it will not be a square but a rectangle of the unit's exact size (plus the spacing, if set)  description the description keyword contains a human-friendly name for the group that will be used in lists (e.g. in the list all groups radio menu of veafSpawn).\ngroupName the groupName keyword defines the DCS group name used when spawning this group (will be completed with a numerical suffix)\nGroup layout grid and placement algorithm A group template is defined relative to a grid, composed of cells, numbered from left to right and top to bottom :\nThe units in the group will be spawned in their respective cell, or sequentially from the top-left cell if no preferred cell is set.\nLet's describe the algorithm so everything is clear.\nStep 1 First, a layout defines the number of cells (height and width) for the group. At the moment the cells measure by default 10m x 10m. The disposition keyword defines this layout. Here's an example with the Tarawa group defined above :\ndisposition = { h = 3, w = 3},\rStep 2 Then, when a unit is placed in a cell, this cell size grows to accomodate the unit's size.\nWe can add a spacing parameter (in the spawn method call) if needed, to allow for some freedom inside the cells. When set, the size of the cell will be expanded by the size of the unit times the spacing parameter.\nLet's continue with our example ; here the Tarawa itself is placed in cell #2 :\nunits = { {\u0026#34;tarawa\u0026#34;, 2} ... },\rStep 3 This process continues until all the units are placed.\nIn our example, we still have to place 2 Perry frigates in cells #7 and #9 :\nunits = { ... {\u0026#34;PERRY\u0026#34;, 7}, {\u0026#34;PERRY\u0026#34;, 9} },\rStep 4 At the end of the process, we need to compute the size of the rectangle that contains all the group units.\nContinuing with our example :\nAnd we can actually spawn all the units at the center of each cell, with a random variation if the random parameter was set\nActual examples A seemingly realistic russian air defense batteries {\raliases = {\u0026#34;RU-SAM-Shilka-Battery\u0026#34;},\rgroup = {\rdisposition = { h= 5, w= 5},\runits = {\r-- the search radar\r {\u0026#34;Dog Ear radar\u0026#34;, cell = 13}, -- the actual air defense units\r {\u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 Shilka\u0026#34;, hdg = 0, random}, {\u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 Shilka\u0026#34;, hdg = 90, random}, {\u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 Shilka\u0026#34;, hdg = 180, random}, {\u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 Shilka\u0026#34;, hdg = 270, random},\r-- a supply truck or three\r {\u0026#34;Transport Ural-4320-31 Armored\u0026#34;, number = {min=1, max=3}, random},\r},\rdescription = \u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 battery\u0026#34;,\rgroupName = \u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 battery\u0026#34;\r},\r},\rA quite random, but nonetheless deadly air defense group {\raliases = {\u0026#34;generateAirDefenseGroup-RED-5\u0026#34;},\rhidden,\rgroup = {\rdisposition = { h= 7, w= 7},\runits = {\r-- the search radar\r {\u0026#34;Dog Ear radar\u0026#34;, random}, -- Tor battery\r {\u0026#34;Tor 9A331\u0026#34;, hdg = 0, random}, {\u0026#34;Tor 9A331\u0026#34;, hdg = 90, random}, {\u0026#34;Tor 9A331\u0026#34;, hdg = 180, random}, {\u0026#34;Tor 9A331\u0026#34;, hdg = 270, random}, -- Some SA13\r {\u0026#34;Strela-10M3\u0026#34;, number = {min=2, max=4}, random},\r-- Some Shilkas\r {\u0026#34;ZSU-23-4 Shilka\u0026#34;, number = {min=2, max=4}, random},\r-- a supply truck or three\r {\u0026#34;Transport Ural-4320-31 Armored\u0026#34;, number = {min=1, max=3}, random}, },\rdescription = \u0026#34;generateAirDefenseGroup-RED-5\u0026#34;,\rgroupName = \u0026#34;generateAirDefenseGroup-RED-5\u0026#34;,\r},\r},\rA very simple infantry group {\raliases = {\u0026#34;US infgroup\u0026#34;},\rgroup = {\rdisposition = { h = 5, w = 5},\runits = {{\u0026#34;IFV Hummer\u0026#34;, number = {min=1, max=2}, random},{\u0026#34;INF Soldier M249\u0026#34;, number = {min=1, max=2}, random},{\u0026#34;INF Soldier M4 GRG\u0026#34;, number = {min=2, max=4}, random},{\u0026#34;INF Soldier M4\u0026#34;, number = {min=6, max=15}, random}},\rdescription = \u0026#34;US infantry group\u0026#34;,\rgroupName = \u0026#34;US infantry group\u0026#34;,\r},\r},\rHow to use in a mission Depending on the mission, it is possible to spawn groups and units defined with this module by using the commands in the veafSpawn, the veafInterpreter and the veafCombatZone modules.

For most units/groups it will reset to its predefined orders; e.g. _spawn unit, name sa6, speed 15 altitude or alt (default 0) is the altitude of the unit/group (same remarks as speed); e.g. _spawn unit, name sa6, alt 15 heading or hdg (default 0) is the heading of the unit/group (same remarks as speed); e.g. _spawn unit, name sa6, hdg 270  Some parameters are specific to the _spawn unit instruction:\n unitName (default is the unit display name in DCS suffixed with a numeric counter) will be the name this unit will have in the DCS mission (not to be mistaken with the unit type parameter, name); e.g. _spawn unit, name sa6, unitname air-defense-SA6  A special instruction will spawn a specific unit with a JTAC role, and set it as invisible and invincible: _spawn jtac.\nIt has a specific parameter:\n laser (default 1688) can be used to choose a laser code for the JTAC ; e.g. _spawn jtac, laser 1681  Some parameters are specific to the _spawn group instruction:\n  spacing (default 5) is used to add space between a group's units (see veafUnits)\n  isconvoy (default false) if set, makes the group behave like a convoy\n dest (mandatory in this case) the named point where the convoy must go (see veafNamedPoints) patrol (default false) if set, makes the group go back and forth between its spawn point and its destination point offroad (default false) if set, the group will not try and use roads    Examples:\n_spawn unit, name sa6, unitname tbilissi-air-defense country UKRAINE, hdg 245\n_spawn group, name RU-SAM-SA9-Battery, spacing 10\n_spawn group, name US infgroup, isconvoy, dest TBILISSI, speed 15, patrol\nSpawn dynamic groups The _spawn instruction can also spawn dynamic groups; these groups are randomized, and parameters can be used to choose several aspects of this randomization.\nThis is the list of the parameters common to all the dynamic group spawn instructions:\n side (default RED) is the coalition the group(s) will belong to (RED or BLUE) country (default USA for side=blue, RUSSIA for side=red) is the country the group(s) will belong to heading (default 0) is the global heading of the groups; units in the group will have their individual heading (in the template definition) adapted to be relative to this global heading spacing (default 5) is used to add space between a group's units (see veafUnits), but also to add space between the groups  The type of the dynamic group is linked to the instruction itself. Each dynamic group instruction has its own set of parameter.\ninfantry section _spawn infantrygroup will spawn an infantry section (an armored personnel carrier with an infantry section and optional air defense - manpads)\n defense (default 1) will determine the air defense generated for this group:  if 0: no manpad 1..3: between 1 and defense older manpad systems 4..5: between 1 and defense-2 modern manpad systems   armor (default 1) will determine the personnel carrier vehicle:  if 0: a M 818 (BLUE) or a GAZ-3308 (RED) truck 1..3: a IFV Boman (BLUE) or a BTR-80 (RED) 4..5: a M-2 Bradley (BLUE) or a BMP-1 (RED)    armor platoon _spawn armorgroup will spawn an armor platoon (3-6 armored vehicles with optional escorting air defence systems)\n defense (default 1) will determine the air defense generated for this group:  if 0: no air defense 1..3: a Gepard (BLUE) or a ZSU-23-4 Shilka (RED) 4..5: an M6 Linebacker (BLUE) or a 2S6 Tunguska (RED)   armor (default 1) will determine the personnel carrier vehicle:  0..2: random choice between M-2 Bradley, IFV MCV-80, IFV Boman (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMD-1, BRDM-2 (RED) 3: random choice between M-2 Bradley (66%), M-60 (33%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55 (RED) 4: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), M-60 (25%), Leopard-2 (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55, T-72 (RED) 5: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), MBT Leopard1A3 (25%), M-1 Abrams (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-2, BMP-3, T-80UD, T-90 (RED)    air defense battery _spawn samgroup will spawn an air defense battery (multiple air defense launchers/systems, a search radar and support vehicles)\n defense the group will be spawned from the veafUnit template called \u0026ldquo;generateAirDefenseGroup-side-defense\u0026rdquo; where side is either RED or BLUE and defense is the defense parameter value; e.g. generateAirDefenseGroup-RED-3  transport company _spawn transportgroup will spawn a transport company (several trucks with optional escorting air defence systems)\n defense (default 1) will determine the air defense generated for this group, one of these air defense system for every ten trucks:  if 0: no air defense 1: a Gepard (BLUE) or a Ural-375 ZU-23 (RED) 2: a Gepard (BLUE) or a ZSU-23-4 Shilka (RED) 3: an M6 Linebacker (BLUE) or a 2S6 Tunguska (RED) 4..5: an M6 Linebacker and a Gepard (BLUE) or a 2S6 Tunguska and a ZSU-23-4 Shilka (RED)   size (default 10) the number of trucks that will be spawned  full combat group _spawn combatgroup will spawn a full combat group, composed of multiple infantry groups, multiple armor platoons, several transport companies and 1 or 2 air defense groups\n defense (default 1) will be used for every generated group (see above) armor (default 1) will be used for every generated group (see above) size (default 10) will be used for every generated group (see above) and condition the groups that will be generated:  between size-2 and size+1 infantry groups between size-2 and size+1 armor platoons 1 or 2 air defense groups if defense is not 0 between 1 and size transport companies    Examples:\n_spawn samgroup, defense 3, side blue\n_spawn armorgroup, defense 0, armor 5, side red\n_spawn combatgroup, defense 1, armor 2, size 5, side blue\nSpawn convoys The _spawn convoy instruction will generate a dynamic convoy, and send it on its route to a named point (see veafNamedPoints).\nThe convoys are tracked and managed in the VEAF SPAWN radio menu.\nIt is possible to find out if a convoy still exists (or was destroyed entirely), find out where it is (or between which points it travels) thanks to smoke markers, or dispose of a convoy.\nThe convoy will be composed of a transport company (see transport company above) and an armor platoon (see armor platoon above).\nThis instruction accepts several parameters:\n destination or dest is the name of a named point where the convoy will drive to offroad (default false) if set, the convoy will not try and use roads size (default 10) the number of trucks that will be spawned; no transport company at all if 0 armor (default 1) will determine the personnel carrier vehicle:  0: no armor platoon 1..2: random choice between M-2 Bradley, IFV MCV-80, IFV Boman (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMD-1, BRDM-2 (RED) 3: random choice between M-2 Bradley (66%), M-60 (33%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55 (RED) 4: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), M-60 (25%), Leopard-2 (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-1, BMP-2, T-55, T-72 (RED) 5: random choice between M-2 Bradley (50%), MBT Leopard1A3 (25%), M-1 Abrams (25%) (BLUE) or BMP-2, BMP-3, T-80UD, T-90 (RED)    The players can use the following radio menu commands:\n Info on all convoys will output a list of convoys; for each convoy it'll print its name, the number of remaining vehicles, and its position Mark closest convoy route will pop a green smoke at the convoy's starting point, and a red one at the end point Mark closest convoy will pop a white smoke at the convoy's current position Cleanup all convoys will remove all active convoys from the mission  Spawn cargo statics and logistic points These are specific to CTLD and, for it to work, it has to be configured in your mission.\nYou can follow these instructions to configure CTLD in your mission.\ncargo statics Cargo statics (crates, ammo, fuel barrels and the like) can be spawned by the _spawn cargo instruction\nThis instruction accepts these parameters:\n name (default ammo_cargo) is the type of cargo to be spawned. It must be a valid cargo known by DCS and transportable. The HELP - all cargoes radio menu command will list all valid values; e.g. _spawn cargo, name barrels_cargo smoke if set, will pop a green smoke where the cargo is spawned; e.g. _spawn cargo, smoke unitName (default is the cargo display name in DCS suffixed with a numeric counter) will be the name this cargo will have in the DCS mission (not to be mistaken with the unit type parameter, name); e.g. _spawn cargo, name barrels_cargo, unitname and-two-barrels-of-rhum  Cargo spawned is registered with CTLD and transportable by whatever aircraft CTLD is configured to accept as a transport aircraft.\nlogistic points Logistic points are static DCS units that marks the center of a CTLD logistic zone.\nWhen spawned with the _spawn logistic instruction, they are registered with CTLD and when inside their action radius, aircraft configured in CTLD as transport aircrafts can load troops and spawn deployable crates with CTLD.\nThis instruction does not accept any parameter.\nSpawn bombs and artillery shelling The _spawn bomb instruction will create and detonate a bomb at the specified location. The bomb detonation will destroy or damage the surrounding units, statics and world objects.\nThis instruction accepts this parameter:\n power (default 100) is the bomb detonation power (limited to 1000)  NB: artillery shelling is not yet available.\nSpawn smoke markers and illumination flares smoke marker Smoke markers of multiple colors can be spawned by the players with the _spawn smoke instruction\nThis instruction accepts this parameter:\n color (default red) is the color of the spawned smoke marker (possible values are red, green, orange, blue and white); e.g. _spawn smoke, color orange  illumination flares Illumination flares will light up a zone when the night is too dark to see the targets; they can be spawned with the _spawn flare instruction\nThis instruction accepts this parameter:\n altitude or alt (default 1000) is the altitude (in meters) at which the flare will begin its descent; e.g. _spawn flare, alt 2000  Teleport objects The _teleport instruction can instantly move units or groups.\nThis instruction accepts this mandatory parameter:\n name is the name of the DCS group that will be moved; e.g. _teleport, name Arco  Destroy objects The _destroy instruction can instantly destroy units inside a radius around the chose point.\nThe destroyed objects do not leave any wreck and are simply removed from the mission.\nThis instruction accepts this parameter:\n radius (default 150) is the destruction radius (in meters); e.g. _destroy, radius 500  "

	"content": "Introduction CTLD is a third-party script that allow the players of a well-configured mission to transport troops and deployable crates with helicopters and transport airplanes.\nHow to set up a mission Let's start by saying that you can clone the VEAF-Demo-Mission repository and use it as an example (or fork it and create a new mission from your fork).\nLoad the script and its prerequisites In DCS mission editor, set up a \u0026ldquo;mission start\u0026rdquo; trigger that will :\n load the following scripts (in order) :  mist.lua (from the community folder) CTLD.lua   run the following lua code : ctld.initialize(); load a new file that you'll write, and that will initialize the veafAsset script specifically for your mission ; usually it's called veafCTLDConfig.lua, and if you follow our model (VEAF-Demo-Mission) it's stored in the scripts folder of your mission.  How to configure the script in a mission The veafCTLDConfig.lua file should contain CTLD-specific configuration.\nAs CTLD is not part of the VEAF Mission Creation Tools, we'll simply explain the most often used sections of this configuration. For more information, see the CTLD project page.\nPickup zones The ctld.pickupZones table defines a list of Trigger Zone (or ship) names that will be configured as CTLD pickup zones.\nIn the active radius of a pickup zone, one can load troops and spawn deployable crates.\nExample:\nctld.pickupZones = {\r{ \u0026#34;pickzone1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, -1, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0 },\r{ \u0026#34;pickzone2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, -1, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0 },\r{ \u0026#34;pickzone3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, -1, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0 },\r{ \u0026#34;pickzone4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, -1, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0 },\r{ \u0026#34;pickzone5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, -1, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0 },\r{ \u0026#34;CVN-74 Stennis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, 10, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0, 1001 }, -- instead of a Zone Name you can also use the UNIT NAME of a ship\r { \u0026#34;LHA-1 Tarawa\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;, 10, \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;, 0, 1002 }, -- instead of a Zone Name you can also use the UNIT NAME of a ship\r }\rTransport pilots The ctld.transportPilotNames table lists the names of all the pilots that will be allowed to use CTLD. If a client unit in the mission has a pilot name that is in this list, then the player piloting this unit will be allowed to use CTLD.\nExample:\nctld.transportPilotNames = {\r\u0026#34;helicargo1\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;helicargo1\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;helicargo2\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;helicargo3\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;helicargo4\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;helicargo5\u0026#34;\r}\rLoad limits The ctld.unitLoadLimits table overloads the default load limits for specific unit types. In the following example, we allow the Mi-8 to transport 24 units of load:\nctld.unitLoadLimits = {\r[\u0026#34;Mi-8MT\u0026#34;] = 24\r}\r"
