      <description>Introduction The demo mission is a project in the VEAF GitHub repository that can be forked to serve as the basis of a new mission using the VEAF Mission Creation Tools. It does not include all the features of the tools; for a more in-depth example, you can check the VEAF-Open-Training-Mission repository.
How to set up a mission Start by forking or cloning the VEAF-Demo-Mission repository. You can then use the files you cloned as an example, or use your fork to create a new mission.</description>

      <description>Introduction In a mission using the VEAF Mission Creation Tools, the script have to be loaded through triggers. This chapter will explain how to setup such triggers, and also how to use a dynamic loading method for development.
To load a script in a DCS mission, the easiest way is to create a MISSION START trigger, and make it execute a DO SCRIPT FILE action, loading the script.
If you do this for all the community and veaf scripts, they will be stored in the mission file (in the &amp;ldquo;I10N\default&amp;rdquo; folder) and referenced for loading.</description>

      <description>Some of the VEAF Tools scripts add entries to the DCS communication menu (a.k.a the radio menu).
This is the tree-like menu that the player can use to communicate with ATC, the AWACS, the ground crew and other actors in the DCS mission.
The last option in the main menu is always &amp;ldquo;F10. Other&amp;rdquo;. All the custom radio menus will be grouped here.
So, in order for the player to interact with the VEAF scripts using the radio menu, sÂ·he will have to:</description>

      <description>A lot of the VEAF Mission Creation Tools functionalities are controlled through commands entered in the text of user marks on the F10 map.
This means that, during runtime, a player can go to the F10 map and create a user mark
In this mark, the player enters a text that the VEAF Tools scripts will understand. Of course, it has to follow a specific syntax (see the documentation of the modules) for more detail.</description>

      <description>The VEAF Mission Creation Tools contains .lua scripts that are meant to be ran inside a DCS mission, and also other tools that are meant to act on a mission file from the outside.
These tools are mainly used in the mission building and extraction pipelines (see workflow).
Normalizer DCS mission editor saves the mission data as a set of .lua files compressed in the .miz mission file.

      <description>Introduction This module creates a radio menu (VEAF / ASSETS) that allows the players to manage the mission air assets.
For each air asset, they can request information (is the asset alive ? What information has the mission maker set up - radio frequencies, TACANs, etc.), respawn the asset (and its eventual linked DCS groups, e.g. escort planes for a High Value Target), dispose of the asset (if set up by the mission maker).</description>

      <description>Introduction This module helps place a Forward Armament and Refuel Point (FARP) in a mission. It also helps with grass runways (hence its name). The mission creator simply has to place one or few units in the DCS mission editor, and name them following a specific convention; the script will then automatically find and dress these units up at mission start.

      <description>Introduction This module creates a radio menu (VEAF / CARRIER OPERATIONS) that allows the players to manage the aircraft carriers (CV) in the mission, at runtime.
For each CV, they can get information (including ATC) and start/end carrier air operations (CAO). During CAO, the CV will sail into the wind at a speed and heading computed to get a specific wind speed right in front of the runway. A rescue helicopter (Pedro) and an emergency tanker can be placed in the mission and will be launched and recovered at appropriate times.</description>

 groups that have been defined with the veafUnits module units that are defined in DCS (either via their veafUnits alias, or their DCS type name dynamic groups that use templates defined with the veafUnits module, but can be configured and are randomized convoys that can go from a point to another, and be tracked and managed with radio commands cargo statics and logistic points that are registered with CTLD and can be transported via helicopter bombs that can destroy scenery, units and groups (even client aircrafts and vehicles) smoke and illumination flares  It also provides commands to :</description>
