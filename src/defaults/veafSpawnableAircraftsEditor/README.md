This folder contains default collections for the VEAF Spawnable Aircrafts Editor.

This can be used as the default configuration for your next mission.

These collections of planes can then be spawned in the missions using the `_spawn cap` command or the `-cap` shortcut.

The planes are grouped in collections that represent the relative difficulty to defeat them : EASY, NORMAL, HARD; and some of them are fighter settings.luapairs (they end with X2).
